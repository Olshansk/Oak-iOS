# Oak-iOS

An app I built a couple years ago for students in class.

Students very often fall behind or get confused during class and are too afraid to speak up or ask questions.

This app lets students:
- Ask questions
- See questions other students have asked
- Upvote / downvote questions they would like the professor / instructor to answer
- Rate their current understanding of the material being taught

This app lets instructors:
- View most popular questions asked by students
- View a chart showing the distribution of how well the material being taught is understood
