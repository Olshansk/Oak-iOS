## Overview

An iOS app I built a couple years ago to improve the quality of classes for students.

It's common for students to fall behind or get confused during class. More often that not, they tend not to speak up, or ask the professor to clarify a certain point out of fear of seeming incompetent in front of their classmates. This app was meant to solve that problem by letting students annonymously ask questions and provide feedback of their understanding as the class proceeded. 

## Students

Students can do the following:
- Ask questions
- View questions other students have asked
- Upvote / downvote questions they would like the instructor to answers
- Rate their undderstanding of the material being taught

## Instructors

Instructors can do the following:
- View the most popular questions asked by students
- View a chart showing the distribution of how students rated their understanding of the material currently being taught in class

Disclaimer: The server is not up and this hasn't been compiled for a couple years, so I do not know the current state of the app.
